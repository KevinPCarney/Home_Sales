# Home_Sales
This is a repository for the week 22 homework.  As part of our exposure to "Big Data" we were made aware of relevant the nature of time is with regards to executing SQL queries.  The lessons that were associated with this homework involved various methods such as caching dataframes and partitioning to understand how various methods can reduce the overall time it takes for SQL queries to execute.  For this work a CSV titled "home_sales_revised.csv" was read into a google collab document.  There was not any cleaning of this data that was required.  The information was put into a table titled home_sales, and a number of SQL queries were ran against the table.  After the initial queries, we applied caching and partitioning and compared how long it took for the same SQL query to execute using those methods.  Overall, it seemed that caching the table was the fastest way to accomplish the query, but partitioning was faster than running the query without it.
